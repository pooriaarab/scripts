## Install

<!-- for example: https://board.example -->
```
__LIVE_URL__
```

The live app. Paste the same URL into the About panel homepage.

## Run it locally

Every service this process talks to, including the ones that have been running on your machine since you wrote them.

<!-- for example: `bun run dev` on :3000 -->
<!-- for example: `bun run api` on :8787 -->
<!-- for example: `docker compose up db` -->
<!-- for example: `docker compose up redis` -->
| Service | What it is | How to start it |
|---|---|---|
| `__APP_SERVICE__` | the web process | `__APP_START__` |
| `__API_SERVICE__` | the API | `__API_START__` |
| `__DB_SERVICE__` | Postgres | `__DB_START__` |
| `__QUEUE_SERVICE__` | the queue | `__QUEUE_START__` |

```bash
__LOCAL_UP_COMMAND__
```

## Quick start

<!-- for example: the card in Review with your name on it. -->
Open `__LOCAL_URL__`, sign in as `__DEV_USER__`, and move one card. You should see `__QUICK_START_OUTPUT__`.

## Why

<!-- for example: not a Jira replacement and not a team chat. -->
For __WHO__, who today uses __ALTERNATIVE__. Not for __WHO_NOT__.

## Usage

<!-- for example: drop a card on Review and the owner field fills. -->
<!-- for example: paste a pull request URL and the card links it. -->
| Action | What happens |
|---|---|
| `__ACTION_1__` | `__ACTION_1_RESULT__` |
| `__ACTION_2__` | `__ACTION_2_RESULT__` |

## How it works

<!-- for example: the browser holds the board; the API writes events; Postgres is the source of truth. -->
